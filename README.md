## For Developers

The idea to make this project open source goes after the idea that everyone can take a part in the development.

We invite everyone to take a part in the development by implementing new types of sources and creating community plugins.

## Project structure

- **Interfaces** - the folder where all types of front-end code will be located. Initially, it is assumed that there will be different types of front-end solutions, written using different frameworks for different devices.
- **API** - the back-end part of the project. Also it is assumed that the project could change the back-end language, database - therefore all code implementation are split into different folders represented by language that is used there.
